# CS-340-Term-Project


    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
    Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets
    to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
        -One of the best ways to write code so that it is maintainable, readble and adaptaable is to keep it modular and broken down into components. For example
        in this project the whole can be broken down into three parts. There is the database where all the data is store, the middleware that acts as an interface between
        the database and the front end where the data is displayed and viewed. Each of this pieces can be modified or changed with very little impact to the other two parts. 
        


    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or
    dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from 
    previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
